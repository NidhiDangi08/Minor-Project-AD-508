# Design_and_Development of an E-Healthcare Recommendation system. 
This project aims to address  that analyzes user data and symptoms to predict diseases and provide personalized health insights, focusing on conditions like heart health and diabetes. It offers tailored recommendations to improve overall well-being..

# Features
Dataset: The dataset was taken from kaggle.com 

Machine Learning Model: A logistic regression multiclass classifier is used to predict .

User-Friendly Interface:
Frontend developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an interactive and responsive user experience.

Backend built with Django for robust and secure data handling.

SQLite Database: Stores user data efficiently for seamless integration with the web application.

Data Visualization: Key insights from the dataset are presented in a user-friendly manner for better understanding.
# How It Works

user have page for login or signup.

Users input their  data  through an intuitive form on the web application.

The data is processed and passed to the trained logistic regression model for predictions.

The model predicts the user's diseases based on their input data.

# Technology Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
